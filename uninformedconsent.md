Thank you for agreeing to participate in this research study! This document provides important information about what you will be asked to do during the research study, about the risks and benefits of the study, and about your rights as a research subject.

Do not agree to participate in this research study unless the research team has answered your questions and you decide that you want to be part of this study.

The purpose of this research study is to evaluate how accurately a user can click on differently-sized circles on screen. During the study, you will be randomly presented with several trials where each trial spawns a randomly placed circle on the screen. There will be a total of 160 trials, and each trial will take anywhere from 1 to 5 seconds, depending on your speed. The entire study should take no longer than 15 minutes to complete.

To participate in this study, you must be able to click circles on a screen using a mouse/touchpad/etc., and be able to do that consistently for roughly 15 minutes.

To collect data, our software will record how much you move the mouse, how long it takes you to successfully complete each trial, and whether you make any errors. This information will be recorded anonymously, and no personally identifiable information will be collected.

There will be no compensation for this study.

You may end your participation in the study at any time. If you wish to end your participation, please notify one of the researchers. If you decide to end your participation early, any results collected by the software for your session will not be saved.
